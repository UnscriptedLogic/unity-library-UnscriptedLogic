## What
- A library that houses common logic across games. It currently contains logic for 
  - common math and randomizing operations
  - common raycasting operations
  - a simple currency handler
  - an endless spawning system

## Why
- To store my re-usable code for rapid prototyping or for participating in game jams (that allow re-using code. No it's not cheating I swear) 
- To hide the logic somewhere else, only exposing what is really needed.
